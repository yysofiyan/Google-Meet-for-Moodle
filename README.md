# Google-Meet-for-Moodle

Hi  . . 👋🏻

I already fixed the plugin for Moodle 3.11 and 4.0, for the following issue:

```bash
{
"error": "idpiframe_initialization_failed",
"details": "You have created a new client application that uses libraries for user authentication or authorization that will soon be deprecated. New clients must use the new libraries instead; existing clients must also migrate before these libraries are deprecated. See the Migration Guide for more information."
}
```

You can check the code here: [DOWNLOADS](https://github.com/yysofiyan/Google-Meet-for-Moodle/raw/main/MoodleGMeet_311_40-main.zip) 🔥

Thank you!!
